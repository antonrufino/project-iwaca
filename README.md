## Installing bower
Bower can be used (negotiable) for maintaining frontend dependencies. We won't always have an Internet connection so might as well have local copies of necessary libraries e.g. AngularJS, jQuery, etc.

```bash
sudo npm install bower -g
```

## Installing project dependencies
```bash
bower install # Install stuff needed
```
